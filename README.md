## Mammalian Phenotype Ontology script

This is a script to import the MPO, originally in OBO format to tabular format that can be easily handled with R.

The MPO is under development as a community effort to provide standard terms for annotating mammalian phenotype data. An ontology is a standardized, controlled vocabulary that contains phenotypic information (in this particular case phenotypic abnormalities in mouse mutants).

More information can be found here:

The ontology can be visualized here through an ontology browser:
